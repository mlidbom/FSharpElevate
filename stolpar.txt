	How vs What (unfiltered -> printMatching isSomeThing)
	
	even with CQS you need one method for each printMatching isSomeThing combination 

Code that resembles how you think about the problem.
	Rules ? Results (Pattern matching)

	Data abstraction
		Limited Known Cases mostly structural meaning ? Discriminated unions
		Unlimited cases ? Classes
		Single small datatype ? Record	

	Linear stream-style code vs nested vs temporary variables
